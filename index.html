		<h1>BLUE LIGHT</h1>
		
		<h2>Blue light? Sounds familiar?</h2>
		<p>Today, in the world of modern technology people spend enormous amount of time behind phone and computer screens. Many people are wasting time texting each other rather than actually spending time together in person. </p>

		<p>We all stare at our screens all day long and if we end up with visual impairment or with any other similar health condition we blame the blue light that comes from our computer screens. But that is a complete nonsense.
 Yes there are many sources that are convincing us that blue light from electronic screens is making us blind, but those are just fake news, news without any scientific proofs, bases. 
The next time you will be reading some stupid article on how bad blue light is for your eyes just stop reading it and find some real information about the “infamous” blue light.
