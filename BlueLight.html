		<h1>What blue light actually is?</h1>
		<p>Blue light is a range of the visible light spectrum. It has wavelenght beetween 400 and 450 nanometers (human eye is typically responding to wavelenghts from 380 to about 740 nm).</p>
		<h2>Bad for eyes?</h2>
		<p>Blue light has more energy per photon of light than any other color in the visible spectrum. That is why there are so many concerns about its effects; blue light is most likely the one to cause damage in various cells of human body when absorbed at high enough doses.
Blue light that comes from computers, smartphones, tablets, TVs, â€¦ is not harmful to human eye. The amount of blue light that this screens are giving off is too small to be dangerous.</p>
